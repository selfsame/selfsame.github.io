# 2017 in review

## New Libraries

### [github.com/selfsame/soa](https://github.com/selfsame/soa)

A clojurescript [structure of arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOS_and_SOA) datatype. These are immutable collections of data with low memory usage (much lower than vectors of records). Designed with mentorship by Brandon Bloom.

### [github.com/selfsame/tenlet](https://github.com/selfsame/tenlet)

A clojure telnet library with handlers for some of the fancier telnet protocols like single key input and client terminal sizing.  If you're looking to make a MUD with clojure, this would be a great place to start.

### [pico8 libs](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?uid=24591&mode=carts)

Three tiny pico8 code libraries. I also ported [Wave Function Collapse to Lua](https://github.com/selfsame/carts/blob/master/wfc.p8), but didn't release it as the pico8's integer limitations make it unusable for non trivial patterns.

## New Tools

### [open VR sculpting app](https://github.com/selfsame/sculptgl)

A fork of the webgl based [SculptGL](https://github.com/stephomi/sculptgl) for VR.

Works with both the HTC Vive and Occulus Rift, but it's a pretty "bare boned" adaptation with no 3D interface.  The neat feature here is mesh-surface sculpting in VR, which IMO allows for a better control of detail and form than the current signed distance field based VR tools.

### [github.com/arcadia-unity/ArcadiaGodot](https://github.com/arcadia-unity/ArcadiaGodot)

Now that the Godot game engine [embeds mono](https://godotengine.org/article/introducing-csharp-godot), it's possible to use clojureCLR.  This is a *very* minimal adaptation of Arcadia, which brings clojure to the Unity game engine.

## New Games

### [Swapland](https://arcadia-clojure.itch.io/swapland)

This year's Arcadia community's Procjam entry.  We had a novel idea (top down shooter where you become what you kill), solid planning for how parts were [defined and combined into entites](https://github.com/selfsame/procadia2017), and an interesting way to [define AI behaviour](https://github.com/selfsame/procadia2017/blob/master/Assets/game/ai.clj#L75) from timeline state machines.

### [writo](https://github.com/selfsame/tenlet/blob/game/src/tenlet/scratch.cljc)

A tradition on [tilde.town](https://tilde.town) is making interactive toys for the terminal.  Writo is a telnet based multiplayer graffiti wall.  Users can walk around and write things.

## Prototypes

Following some work making an in game Unity Clojure repl, I tried out a VR "marimba style" keyboard version.  Typing feels ok, if a bit slow.  The error messages were pretty cool, as they would stretch out into the horizon.

![clj-vr](https://s3.amazonaws.com/screenularity/cljvr04.gif)

This is a bit of a novel concept: 3 Dimensional VR snake. The snake follows the orientation of the handheld controllers. Spent quite a bit of time getting the clojure code down to 0 memory allocation during updates, which worked thanks to the [Magic](https://github.com/nasser/magic) compiler.

## Sculpting

I managed to do some digital sculpting here and there, mainly with Oculus Medium, Sculptris, and Blender.
